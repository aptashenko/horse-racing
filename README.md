An animated horse racing game built with Vue 3 and Pinia. Players can start races, see results, and watch horses race on a fun track with a finish line.

## Technologies Used

- **Vue 3 (Composition API)**  
  Chosen for its reactive system, simplicity, and modern syntax. The Composition API enables better logic reuse and cleaner code.

- **Pinia (as setup function)**  
  Used as the state management library. It is the official Vue 3 alternative to Vuex â€” lighter, simpler, and more intuitive to use. In smaller cases, I used composables to manage local state.

- **Vite**  
  Provides near-instant server start and optimized bundling.

- **Vitest**  
  Used for unit testing.
